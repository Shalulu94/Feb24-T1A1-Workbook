### Q1: **Identify** and **explain** common and important components and concepts of web development markup languages:

A Markup language is text-encoding system which defines how the layout and presentation of text and images should appear in a digital document (Samy Sadok, 2023). It gives us the ability to structure and format content as well as a standardized way to define elements which makes it easier for computers and software applications to interpret and display content (Lenovo). 

Some examples of popular markup languages include:
- HTML
- XML
- XHTML
- SGML

Markup languages focus on the presentation and structure of content on a webpage and a well structured website facilitates easy use by humans and computer programs such as search engines. Based on this, a couple of markup language categories include Semantic Markup and Presentational Markup:

- Semantic Markup: Helps to define the different elements on your webpage. The same fomatting can be achieved using non-semantic tags such as <.div> or <.span> but semantic elements define each element which makesit easier for search engines or other parties to better understand the content (Samy Sadok, 2023). Some examples of semantic markup elements include:
    - Headings
    - Nav
    - Section
    - Article
    - Footer
- Presentational Markup: Directly affects contents appearance on the webpage by using specific tags within the content to impact display features. These tags are typically added directly within the markup language and within the content. This is now no longer best practise and we have other methods of updating design features away from the content and structure. 

Another important concept of markup languages in web web development is related to responsiveness and accessibility. Responsiveness relates to how a webpage's structure will change depending on the device that a user has accessed the webpage on. It is important for the structure of a webpage to shift fluidly across different devices to ensure that all information is present and continues t be displayed in an accurate and cmoplete format. 

Proper accessbility enables user with a disabilityto access and interact with a website. Markup languages can be interpreted by screen readers and other assistive technologies allowing websites to reach all users. Semantic elements already assist with this as the already add meaning to the content structure of your website via their specific tags (Samy Sadko, 2023)
