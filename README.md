All questions and answers will be included in this markdown document

## Q1: **Identify** and **explain** common and important components and concepts of web development markup languages:

A Markup language is text-encoding system which defines how the layout and presentation of text and images should appear in a digital document (Samy Sadok, 2023). It gives us the ability to structure and format content as well as a standardized way to define elements which makes it easier for computers and software applications to interpret and display content (Lenovo). 

Some examples of popular markup languages include:
- HTML
- XML
- XHTML
- SGML

Markup languages focus on the presentation and structure of content on a webpage and a well structured website facilitates easy use by humans and computer programs such as search engines. Based on this, a couple of markup language categories include Semantic Markup and Presentational Markup:

- Semantic Markup: Helps to define the different elements on your webpage. The same fomatting can be achieved using non-semantic tags such as <.div> or <.span> but semantic elements define each element which makesit easier for search engines or other parties to better understand the content (Samy Sadok, 2023). Some examples of semantic markup elements include:
    - Headings
    - Nav
    - Section
    - Article
    - Footer
- Presentational Markup: Directly affects contents appearance on the webpage by using specific tags within the content to impact display features. These tags are typically added directly within the markup language and within the content. This is now no longer best practise and we have other methods of updating design features away from the content and structure. 

Another important concept of markup languages in web web development is related to responsiveness and accessibility. Responsiveness relates to how a webpage's structure will change depending on the device that a user has accessed the webpage on. It is important for the structure of a webpage to shift fluidly across different devices to ensure that all information is present and continues to be displayed in an accurate and complete format. 

Proper accessbility enables user with a disabilityto access and interact with a website. Markup languages can be interpreted by screen readers and other assistive technologies allowing websites to reach all users. Semantic elements already assist with this as the already add meaning to the content structure of your website via their specific tags (Samy Sadko, 2023)

## Q2: Define the features of the following technologies that are essential in terms of the development of the internet. Explain how each technology has contributed to the development of the internet:
 - **Packets** - When data is transmitted over a network it is broken down into smaller parts known as "packets". The purpose of this is to ensure that network paths do not get congested with large files and allows for efficient transmission. A packet typically consists of a header and a payload. The header includes information about the source and destination addresses, sequencing information on how to reproduce the original file once all packets have been received and routing information. The payload includes the actual data that is being transmitted
 - **IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6)** - An IP Address is short for Internet Protocol Address and is a unique identifier for a device or network that connects to the internet. It allows for computers within a network to identify, communicate and transfer data between each other. Two versions of commonly used IP Addreses are IPv4 and IP v6.IPv4 addresses utilize a 32-bit numerical format, accommodating around 4.3 billion devices. With the rapid expansion of users on the internet, these IP addresses were being consumed and would eventually become exhausted. In 1998, IPv6 was introduced which was a new protocol using a 128 
 Recognizing the impending depletion of available IPv4 addresses, IPv6 was introduced by the Internet Engineering Task Force in 1998. Employing a 128-bit scheme, IPv6 vastly expands the address pool to accommodate up to 340 trillion trillion trillion unique addresses, effectively resolving the address exhaustion concern and fostering the internet's continued growth. Moreover, IPv6 offers additional advantages over IPv4, including built-in Quality of Service (QoS), integrated network security via IPsec, support for multicasting, and larger packet headers.
 - **routers and routing** - 
 - **domains and DNS**

 ## Q6: A hypothetical client has sent you an email (shown in the Q6 Email section), asking for you to build them a website. Write an appropriate, professional email response that shows your understanding of the clientâ€™s needs for the website, as well as an understanding of appropriate technologies or tools needed to build the website yourself.

 Hi Alex,

 Thank you for your email and providing detail regarding your website requirements and objectives. The good news is that based on your requirements, we can definitely design and develop a website suitable to your needs and hopefully help attract more visitors to your museum. 

 In order to address your requirements, the website will require some key features such as:

 - **Multi-page website**: This essentially means that your website will have multiple different pages that users can navigate between using a navigation bar that will be present and static across all pages. By having multiple pages on a website, you will be able to separate different topics you want to display to your customers onto their own specific pages. This will also help users to navigate to the a specific page quickly if they wanted to quickly find the answer to something. For example, if a customer wanted to quickly find out your contact details to phone/email, they could navigate directly to the 'Contact Us' page. Some page titles you will need based on your requirements would be:
    - About us - Brief description about the museum, it's purpose and history
    - Exhibits - Outline what exhibits are on showcase in the museum
    - Gallery - Display page to showcase your artifacts. Can include pictures and descriptions
    - Contact Us - Contact details and potentially even a contact form they can fill out
    - Getting here - Direction details

- **Semantic HTML**: HTML will be the markup language used to input all of the text, visuals and elements that you want to include in your website. In order to make your website as accessible as possible, we will ensure to use semantic HTML tags where possible as this allows better access for users with impairments. It will also allow search engines to better read your website and return your website to users searching for it. 

- **CSS Styling**: After all the elements have been included, we will use CSS to style your website to make it look appealing to the user and include features that alow it to be more interactive and responsive. As we don't know whether your users will be accessing your website on their computer, tablet or mobile we need to ensure that the website is responsive and can adjust itself depending on the users device. This ensures that no matter how or when the users acces your website, it will always be presented in a format that is clear, appealing and easy to use. We can also add transitions and animation effects to different elements to help interactivity as users scroll through your website. All of these functions can be built according to your requests. 

- **Domain**: You will also want this website to have a domain name similar to your Super Awesome Museum name so that it is relevant and easier for users to find. We can ensure that a domain name is reserved for you and once we deploy the website online, people will be able to access it using something relevant such as www.Superawesomemuseum.com. 

We hope that this gives you a bit of an idea of what we can do when building your website. We want to ensure that your website delivers all the necessary information to your users in an interactive, responsive and meaningful manner. 

Hope to hear from you soon and assist in building this website. 

Thank you,

Shahrul
